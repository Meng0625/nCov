Run the script in  ./scripts in the order of build-tree.py -> plot.py.

If your OS is macOS, you can directly run the script by python3 with package pandas/ete3/scipy.

Otherwise you need to install Igphyml and put it in the "./source" dir and repalace the Clustal-omega that fits your OS. For this, refer to https://igphyml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html and http://www.clustal.org/omega.

Contact me if you get any problems.
